    "Here is what each function imported above does (and where you can find more details, such as the function's definition and any code used to test it):\n",
    "\n",
    "`word_frequency` takes in a data frame and a number $n$. The data frame must have a column called \"Transcripts\". It returns a series of the percentage of each transcript that consists of the $n$ most common words in the transcript. It is found in the notebook `word_frequency.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "`named_years` also takes in a data frame with a \"Transcripts\" column. It returns a series of the average year mentioned in each speech, scaled by dividing by 2020. If no years are mentioned in the speech, a NaN is put in that speech's row. It can be found in `average_named_years.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`year_from_wars` is similar - it returns an average year based on the wars mentioned in the speech. In this case, it is a scaled version of the start date of all wars mentioned in the speech. It is found in `year_from_wars.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`positivity_score`, found in `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`, takes in the transcript of a single speech, as well as a classifier generated by `build_sentiment_model`. The sentiment model is trained using Twitter data containing tweets labeled \"negative\" or \"positive.\" Using the sentiment model, the positivity score function will parse each sentence of the transcript and determine if the sentiment of that individual sentence is negative or positive. It then returns an estimate of how positive the sentiment expressed in the speech is as a ratio the number of positive sentences divided by the total number of sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following functions are all found in `simple_functions.ipynb`.\n",
    "- `mreplace` takes in a string of text and two lists of strings (which must be of equal length). It replaces every occurence of a string in the first list with the corresponding string from the second list and returns the result. There is also an optional parameter that allows you to set a maximum number of times for each string to be replaced.\n",
    "- `sentlen` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of the average sentence length of each string.\n",
    "- `wordlen` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of the average word length of each string.\n",
    "- `avesylls` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of the average number of syllables per word for each string.\n",
    "- `SWprop` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of the proportion of stop words in each string.\n",
    "- `readlvl` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of Flesch Reading Ease scores of each string. The Flesch Reading Ease score is a measure of how easy or confusing a text is to read.\n",
    "- `sentcount` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of the number of sentences in each string.\n",
    "- `wordcount` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of the number of words in each string.\n",
    "\n",
    "`PCAphrases` takes in a data frame that includes only a \"Presidents\" and \"Transcripts\" column, as well as a number $n$ (the length of each phrase), and the number of features you want. It creates a list of all $n$-word phrases (also known as $n$-grams) in any of the transcripts, and then finds how many times each phrase appears in each transcript. This creates hundreds of features, which is reduced to the desired number of features via principle component analysis. The output is a data frame of the resulting PCA features. The function can be found in the `word_pca.ipynb` notebook. Because of this function's long run time, we were unable to use it for any phrases with 2 or more words - in other words, we only used it to find PCA features based on the frequency of individual words, rather than the frequency of $n$-grams with $n\\geq2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Confusion_Image` is a modified confusion matrix that in addition to showing the counts for true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, it shows the category's mean confidence as a color on a scale, calculated from the classifier's `predict_proba()` method.\n",

    "Let's begin an investigation and visualize our data to identify any significant differences between how the two selected presidents speak by plotting the distributions of some of our feature. We will use The kdeplot from Seaborn as it is the easiest way we can produce normalized distribution curve for each president's data. Don't worry about the units on the density axis. According to the documentation of the function at https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.kdeplot.html, this is a common source of confusion:\n",

    "\"While kernel density estimation produces a probability distribution, the height of the curve at each point gives a density, not a probability. A probability can be obtained only by integrating the density across a range. The curve is normalized so that the integral over all possible values is 1, meaning that the scale of the density axis depends on the data values.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the x axis, the plot shows some values outside the range of our data. This is simply an artifact of how the function \"smoothes\" the curves so that the area under them are equal to one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the function is straightforward. The first parameter is to choose what we are finding the distribution of. Hue simply separates the distribution by president. Fill is self-explanatory. Common_norm is set to false because each curve must be normalized independently since the quantity of data for each president is not equal (this is evident when we incorporate Franklin D Roosevelt into the analysis). Ax is for our subplotting purposes."

It appears that Donald Trump is much more consistent with his tone and language than George Washington, who seems to have a greater variety. Additionally, it is interesting to note that Donald Trump does mention named years and years from wars, but Washington does not at all. Due to these factors, it seems like it would be easy to distinguish the two."

    "The correct classifications of the presidents appear to range from 0.79 to 0.86, indicating that the model did not make its predictions with as high a degree of certainty. Interestingly, the model was most confident in classifying a Roosevelt speech as a Trump speech yet it had the least confidence when classifying a Roosevelt speech as a Trump speech. It is possible that the model is not completely proficient in distinguishing between presidents who have more similar behavior. Washington had no misclassifications and it is possible that this is because his style is very different from the other two, since he lived much further in the past (influencing his style of speech and demeanor) and does not mention years or American wars (obvious filter). Perhaps this is an indication that linguistics and cultural attitudes today are not so much different than in the 1940s."
