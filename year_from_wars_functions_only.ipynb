    "### Year Estimates from Wars Discussed in the Speech\n",
    "One expectation we had for presidential speeches is that a lot of them would discuss or mention wars the United States was fighting at that time. For this reason, we thought that analyzing which wars were discussed in each speech could potentially serve as a useful yardstick for which president was talking. Certainly, some presidents would discuss wars from the past or wars that were also in progress during other president's tenures, but on average we expected that presidents would mostly discuss wars relatively close to the time of their presidency. This notebook creates a function for use later. This function extracts all the wars mentioned in each speech, matches them to a year, averages the years for each speech, and scales the result from 0 to 1."

    "People are unlikely to always refer to wars by their full name. For instance, when talking about the Vietnam War, people are more inclined to say something like \"in Vietnam\" instead of \"in the Vietnam War.\" For this reason, the folowing cells extract the shortened name from the list of wars. This introduced the possibility that the function could find times when presidents mention a region or country without talking about the war associated with it. For instance, the president might be talking about Vietnam's economy instead of referencing the Vietnam War, but the function below won't make that distinction. This problem is somewhat mitigated by the fact that public scrutiny of a region or country tends to roughly correspond with any military engagement in the region. (Still, this is a caveat to keep in mind.)"
