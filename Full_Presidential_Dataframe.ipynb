    "Here is what each function imported above does (and where you can find more details, such as the function's definition):\n",
    "\n",
    "`word_frequency` takes in a data frame and a number $n$. The data frame must have a column called \"Transcripts\". It returns a series of the percentage of each transcript that consists of the $n$ most common words in the transcript. It is found in the notebook `word_frequency.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "`named_years` also takes in a data frame with a \"Transcripts\" column. It returns a series of the average year mentioned in each speech, scaled by dividing by 2020. If no years are mentioned in the speech, a NaN is put in that speech's row. It can be found in `average_named_years.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`year_from_wars` is similar - it returns an average year based on the wars mentioned in the speech. In this case, it is a scaled version of the start date of all wars mentioned in the speech. It is found in `year_from_wars.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`positivity_score`, found in `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`, takes in the transcript of a single speech, as well as a classifier, which is generated by `build_sentiment_model`. It returns an estimate of how positive the sentiment expressed in the speech is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following functions are all found in `Some_functions.ipynb`. They are imported from `Some_functions_Copy.ipynb`, which is just a copy of `Some_functions.ipynb` with everything except the function definitions removed (this was done because `import-ipynb` imports a function by running the entire notebook, and there are cells in the original notebook used to test the functions that take a long time to run.\n",
    "- `mreplace` takes in a string of text and two lists of strings (which must be of equal length). It replaces every occurence of a string in the first list with the corresponding string from the second list and returns the result. There is also an optional parameter that allows you to set a maximum number of times for each string to be replaced.\n",
    "- `sentlen` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of the average sentence length of each string.\n",
    "- `wordlen` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of the average word length of each string.\n",
    "- `avesylls` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of the average number of syllables per word for each string.\n",
    "- `SWprop` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of the proportion of stop words in each string.\n",
    "- `readlvl` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of Flesch Reading Ease scores of each string. The Flesch Reading Ease score is a measure of how easy or confusing a text is to read.\n",
    "- `sentcount` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of the number of sentences in each string.\n",
    "- `wordcount` takes in a series of strings and returns a series of the number of words in each string.\n",
    "\n",
    "`PCAphrases` takes in a data frame that includes only a \"Presidents\" and \"Transcripts\" column, as well as a number $n$ (the length of each phrase), and the number of features you want. It creates a list of all $n$-word phrases (also known as $n$-grams) in any of the transcripts, and then finds how many times each phrase appears in each transcript. This creates hundreds of features, which is reduced to the desired number of features via principle component analysis. The output is a data frame of the resulting PCA features. The function can be found in the `word_pca.ipynb` notebook (it is imported from a copy of said notebook with everything except the function definitions removed for the same reason as the functions from `Some_functions.ipynb`). Because of this function's long run time, we were unable to use it for any phrases with 2 or more words - in other words, we only used it to find PCA features based on the frequency of individual words, rather than the frequency of $n$-grams with $n>2$."
