# CMSE-202-Project
This is the repository for the Group 10 CMSE final project. The subject is fingerprinting text - we will do this for presidential speeches, predicting who gave the speech based on the transcript of the speech. The main notebook is Full_Presidential_Dataframe.ipynb. Other notebooks define functions that are imported into the main notebook using the import-ipynb module.
